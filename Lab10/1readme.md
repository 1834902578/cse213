INTRODUCTON:


Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology . the data item stored first will be accessed first.
 Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).  A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.


USES OF QUEUE:


Queue is used when things donâ€™t have to be processed immediately, but have to be processed in First In First Out order like Breadth First Search This property of Queue makes it also useful in following kind of scenarios.
1.When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.
2.When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.
3.Queue is used in BFS(Breadth First Search) algorithm. It helps in traversing a tree or graph.
4.Queue is also used by Operating systems for job scheduling.
5.Queue is used in networking to handle congestion.
